# 🎓 Analyzing the Impact of Random Factors on Student Performance

This project explores how unpredictable or "random" factors—such as seating assignment, sleep, and testing conditions—can impact student performance on standardized exams. It includes both a LaTeX Beamer presentation and a Jupyter Notebook that implements a regression model.

## 📊 What's Included

### 📽️ Beamer Presentation
A visual overview created using the Madrid Beamer theme. The presentation outlines the problem, methodology, model results, and educational implications.

- `main.tex`: The LaTeX source file
- `presentation.pdf`: The compiled version of the slides
- `/images/`: Any images or charts used in the slides

### 📓 Jupyter Notebook
A full Python-based regression model analyzing student performance.

- `AI1_Final_Project.ipynb`: Contains code for:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Model building (e.g. using `scikit-learn`)
  - Visualizations and interpretation
- `StudentsPerformance.csv`: Dataset used in the notebook
